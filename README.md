# Magpie: A Python Turtle-Based Data Visualiser

This project is a data visualisation tool built with Python and the ``turtle`` graphics library. It parses a list of abstract movement commands and translates them into a visual simulation of a magpie's flight path on a hexagonal grid.

This project was developed for the IFB104: Building IT Systems unit at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The assignment was to create a simulation that could process a "log" of data and display its contents visually.

## 1. Project Overview

The program simulates a magpie's movement starting from a central cell (E5) on a hexagonal grid. It reads a list of movement instructions generated by the ``assignment_1_data_source.py`` module.

The simulation proceeds step-by-step, drawing the magpie's new position and orientation at each cell, until one of three stopping conditions is met. A thematic message is then displayed at the top of the canvas explaining why the simulation ended.

## 2. Core Features

### **Data and Movement**

The data set is a list of lists.

    - **Initial State:** The first item defines the magpie's starting energy (the maximum number of steps) and its initial direction (e.g., 'North', 'South west')

    - **Move Actions:** All subsequent items define one of three actions for each step:
        
        - ``Move forward`` 
        
        - ``Move & turn left`` (moves forward, then turns 60 degrees left)
        
        - ``Move & turn right`` (moves forward, then turns 60 degrees right)

### Stopping Conditions

The simulation halts immediately when one of the following occurs:

    1. **Energy Exhaustion:** The magpie completes its maximum number of steps. The program displays: "The bird became exhausted after X steps!"

    2. **Off-Grid:** The magpie's next move would take it outside the monitored grid perimeter. The program displays: "The bird flew away after X steps!"

    3. **Special Cell:** The magpie lands on one of the three predefined "special" cells (A3, D8, or H6). The program displays: "Found a special cell after X steps!"


## 3. Technical Implementation

The solution is contained within ``assignment_1.py`` and is structured around several key functions:

    - ``visualise_data(random_moves)``: This is the main simulation engine. It initializes the turtle, reads the initial state, and then loops through the energy range. In each loop, it checks for off-grid, special cell, and exhaustion conditions before drawing the next step.

    - ``Magpie(x, y, direction)`` / ``Magpie_moves(x, y, direction)``: These are reusable, parameter-driven functions that draw the magpie symbol.

        - ``Magpie`` uses ``setheading()`` for the absolute initial orientation.

        - ``Magpie_moves`` uses relative turns (``left()``) for all subsequent steps. This was a key requirement to ensure the code was reusable and not hard-coded.

    - ``heading_interger(input_string)``: A helper function that acts as a simple parser, translating human-readable string commands (e.g., 'North west', 'Move & turn left') into integer-based angle changes for the ``turtle``.

    - ``Hexagon(color)``: A utility function to draw the pale green hexagonal cell background for the magpie at each step.

    - ``Print_text(x, y, label)``: A utility function for writing labels and the final status message to the canvas.

## 4. How to Run

    1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

    2. Place all three Python files in the same directory:

        ``assignment_1.py`` (The solution)

        ``assignment_1_config.py`` (Provided canvas setup)

        ``assignment_1_data_source.py`` (Provided data generator)

    3. Run the main solution file from your terminal:
    ```python assignment_1.py```

    4. A new ``turtle`` graphics window will open, and the simulation will run. Each run will produce a new, random data set and a different path.

### Testing with Fixed Data (Seeds)

To test specific, repeatable scenarios, you can provide a "seed" value to the ``data_set()`` function call at the bottom of ``assignment_1.py``.
